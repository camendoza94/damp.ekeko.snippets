# Ekeko/X 
Ekeko/X (*aka damp.ekeko.snippets*) s an Eclipse plugin for transforming Java programs. Its transformation specifications consist of a left-hand side and a right-hand side component. The left-hand side component identifies the subjects of the transformation, while the right-hand side component defines how each identified subject should be rewritten. 

Ekeko/X specifications are decidedly **template**-based. On the **left-hand side**, code templates are used to specify the structural (i.e., instructions and their organization) as well as the behavioral (i.e., the order in which instructions are executed at run-time and the values instructions operate on) characteristics of the intended transformation subjects. This requires a rich, inter-procedural matching semantics. On the **right-hand side**, code templates exemplify the changes to each subject. 

Ekeko/X owes its peculiar name to our meta-programming library for Clojure on which it is founded. This library, called [Ekeko](https://github.com/cderoove/damp.ekeko/tree/master/EkekoPlugin), enables implementing Eclipse plugins as functional programs in which logic queries are embedded seamlessly. 

The following screencast demonstrates an early prototype of Ekeko/X:

## Installation

The Ekeko/X plugin can be built from source ([EkekoSnippets](https://github.com/cderoove/damp.ekeko.snippets/tree/master/EkekoSnippets)) or installed from our Eclipse update-site: [http://soft.vub.ac.be/~cderoove/eclipse/](http://soft.vub.ac.be/~cderoove/eclipse/)

The installation instructions for [Ekeko](https://github.com/cderoove/damp.ekeko/tree/master/EkekoPlugin) should be consulted as well: [README.md](https://github.com/cderoove/damp.ekeko/blob/master/EkekoPlugin/README.md)

Ekeko/X has been tested against [Eclipse Kepler (4.4)](http://www.eclipse.org)
